"What is a process in operating systems?",multiple-choice,"A program in execution,A file on disk,A memory location,A CPU register",0,"A process is a program in execution, which includes the program code, data, and resources.",beginner,Process Management
"What is the main purpose of virtual memory?",multiple-choice,"To increase RAM speed,To allow programs to use more memory than physically available,To encrypt data,To compress files",1,"Virtual memory allows programs to use more memory than physically available by using disk space as an extension of RAM.",intermediate,Virtual Memory
"What is a deadlock?",multiple-choice,"A process that has crashed,A situation where processes are waiting for resources held by each other,A memory leak,A CPU bottleneck",1,"A deadlock occurs when two or more processes are blocked waiting for resources held by each other.",intermediate,Deadlocks
"What is the purpose of a file system?",multiple-choice,"To organize and store data,To encrypt files,To compress data,To backup files",0,"A file system organizes and stores data on storage devices, providing a way to access and manage files.",beginner,File Systems
"What is context switching?",multiple-choice,"Switching between files,Switching between processes,Switching between users,Switching between networks",1,"Context switching is the process of saving the state of one process and loading the state of another process.",intermediate,Process Management
"What is the purpose of a scheduler in an OS?",multiple-choice,"To schedule meetings,To manage CPU allocation among processes,To schedule file operations,To schedule network requests",1,"The scheduler manages CPU allocation among processes, deciding which process runs when.",intermediate,Scheduling
"What is memory fragmentation?",multiple-choice,"Memory corruption,Memory being divided into small unusable pieces,Memory overflow,Memory leak",1,"Memory fragmentation occurs when memory is divided into small, unusable pieces, making it difficult to allocate large blocks.",intermediate,Memory Management
"What is the purpose of a semaphore?",multiple-choice,"To encrypt data,To synchronize processes,To compress files,To backup data",1,"A semaphore is a synchronization primitive used to control access to shared resources by multiple processes.",intermediate,Process Management
"What is thrashing in virtual memory?",multiple-choice,"Memory corruption,Excessive paging that degrades performance,Memory overflow,Memory leak",1,"Thrashing occurs when the system spends more time swapping pages than executing processes, severely degrading performance.",advanced,Virtual Memory
"What is the purpose of an interrupt?",multiple-choice,"To stop the computer,To handle asynchronous events,To encrypt data,To compress files",1,"Interrupts handle asynchronous events like hardware signals, allowing the CPU to respond to external events.",intermediate,Process Management
